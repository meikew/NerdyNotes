# NerdyNotes
A software combining personal knowledge management and spaced repetition

To install, please run the compile.sh script.

The current version only works for Linux (tested on Ubuntu 24.04). To run the programme, you might need to allow it to be executable as a programme and you will have to install a few libraries. Look for libwxbase, libwxgtk and libboost, e.g. in the synaptic package management system, and also install the -dev packages.
